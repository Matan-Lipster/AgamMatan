# AgamMatan
Agam Valdman and Matan Lipster's final project

In general we have three major files that together build our project, within our Git you can see all of their slight variations as we have expiramented with some different models and datasets. The three main parts are the main, the precprocess and the model. Besides that we also have a file named: "delete.py" that we use to print a specific fMRI pkl file.
As previously mentiond we have tested some major changes to our code, those changes can be summarized by: 1)our original transformer code and dataset, 2) using our colleges' dataset and transformer model (fiels with gy_) and 3) using a PLS model with various datasets and options (files with pls_).
